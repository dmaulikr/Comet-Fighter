Power Ups:
Should 2 shield powerups at same time be ok?
Remove b2body for power ups when player gets them?
Make a bigger b2body for spiky shield?
What happens if you get a power up while a power up you got previously is still scaling up?

Long Term: 
Multiplayer?




Optimizations:
Allow b2body sleeping for bodies that are not contacting, if possible
	 (end contact is not called for sleeping bodies...)
Don't check if player is dead every frame for every saved body
	(make player call an function or at least only check once per frame)
Clean up contactvar - removesprite
	(add the sprite to a ccarray and delete it next update)
Make Bullet and Rock Batches invisible if they are empty
Sometimes the is not deallocated [LEAK]



Death screen loading optimizations:

Don't reload player, followvar, or gameoverlayvar when user clicks restart
